# rn-modalalerttest

This is an implementation of this [github issue answer](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/10471#issuecomment-513641325) on how to create a modal that allows an Alert to be shown immediately after a modal closes. If this is not done, there is a high chance that the app will hang when closing a modal and showing an alert immediately.
